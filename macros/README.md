# CodexBridge Macro Registry

The `macros/` directory stores TypeScript macro implementations generated by the CodexBridge
plan watcher. Each macro must be registered in `registry.json` with governance metadata so
that automation and QA can trace macro provenance.

- `registry.json` — machine readable catalogue used by the watcher and CI to verify
  macro availability and enforce policy gates.
- `types.ts` — shared TypeScript definitions (notably `MacroContext`) imported by
  every generated macro stub so that scaffolds compile cleanly.
- `*/**/*.ts` — auto-generated macro entry points. Each file contains descriptive comments and a
  placeholder implementation that throws until a human provides the final logic.

Macros requiring manual review should not be added automatically; instead, store their plans
in `plans/rejected/` with an explanation so that reviewers can handle them manually.
