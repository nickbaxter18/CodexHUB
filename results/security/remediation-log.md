# Secret Remediation Log

Record secret-related incidents here so the security history remains auditable.
Each entry should include:

- Date detected
- Secret name/identifier
- Detection source (hook, CI job, manual scan)
- Rotation status
- Git history cleanup steps (if any)
- Follow-up actions / owners

_This log is empty because no incidents have been recorded yet._
