# Repository Audit â€” 2025-09-26

_Last updated: 2025-09-26T00:00:00Z_

## Knowledge Graph Summary
- Added `results/metrics/repo-graph-summary.md`, a Markdown digest generated alongside the JSON and Mermaid artefacts.
- Snapshot generated via `python scripts/metrics/generate_repo_snapshot.py` at 2025-09-26T21:34Z capturing 12 workspace nodes and seven python roots.
- Dependency hotspot overview now surfaces top import targets (`agents`, `macro_system`, `meta_agent`) without requiring manual graph inspection.

## Issue Catalogue
| Category | Priority | Finding | Evidence | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Documentation | Medium | Context bundle omitted the new digest export, forcing manual navigation to locate the summary. | Context fetch manifest before 2025-09-26. | Extend `scripts/fetch-context.sh` to include the Markdown digest and snapshot generator script. |
| Process | Low | Knowledge graph doc lacked a quick reference for the new digest and bundling workflow. | `docs/context/knowledge-graph.md` prior to update. | Document access paths and refresh instructions in the knowledge graph guide. |

## Proposed Fixes & Effort
- **Context bundle coverage:** One-time script edit (<10 min) to copy the digest and generator into `.context-bundle/`.
- **Documentation refresh:** Short doc update (<5 min) describing the new summary export and fetch workflow.

## Changes Applied Automatically
- Extended `scripts/metrics/generate_repo_snapshot.py` to render `repo-graph-summary.md`.
- Regenerated the metrics bundle, including the new digest, via the snapshot script.
- Updated `docs/context/knowledge-graph.md` and `scripts/fetch-context.sh` to surface the summary in context exports.
- Logged this audit entry in `results/improvements/log.md`.

## Pending Tasks & Next Actions
1. Upload the Markdown digest as a CI artefact alongside JSON/Mermaid outputs once storage support lands.
2. Evaluate adding SAST and secret scan results to the summary when those automations are operational.
3. Review knowledge graph metrics quarterly to confirm the digest continues to capture the most relevant relationships.
