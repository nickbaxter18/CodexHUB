# Quality Assurance Specification

## Purpose

The QA subsystem ensures deliverables satisfy technical, aesthetic and narrative standards before reaching operators or deployment pipelines.

## Architecture

- **QAEngine (`src/qa/index.ts`)** – Coordinates sub-engines, aggregates results and enforces severity thresholds.
- **AestheticChecks (`src/qa/aesthetic.ts`)** – Verifies accessibility, colour harmony and motion guidelines.
- **TechnicalChecks (`src/qa/technical.ts`)** – Executes static analysis hooks, linting and test harness integration.
- **NarrativeChecks (`src/qa/narrative.ts`)** – Evaluates storytelling clarity, tone alignment and fairness guidelines.

## Outputs

Each check returns `QAIssue` objects describing severity, description, impacted files and remediation advice. Aggregated `QAResult` objects summarise pass/fail status, statistics and references to supporting artefacts.

## Integration

- Execution Pipeline halts advancement when QA issues exceed configured thresholds.
- Macros consult QA results to trigger refinement loops.
- Operators view QA traces through the dashboard or CLI tools.

## Stage 1 Behaviour

Implementations compute deterministic heuristics and provide human-readable advice. Stage 2 will incorporate external tools and ML models. Stage 3 adds UI regression and plugin compliance tests.
