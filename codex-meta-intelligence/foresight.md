# Foresight Engine Specification

## Mission

Predict resource consumption, success probability and risk for pending tasks by analysing historical memory records and macro outcomes.

## Components

- **ForesightEngine (`src/foresight/index.ts`)** – Public API orchestrating predictions and risk assessments.
- **Analytics Module (`src/foresight/analytics.ts`)** – Provides statistical computations and summarisation helpers.
- **Risk Module (`src/foresight/risk.ts`)** – Derives qualitative risk levels and mitigation recommendations.

## Inputs

- Historical task durations, QA issue counts and resource usage from memory subsystem.
- Operator feedback scores and fairness metrics.
- Macro definitions containing cost weights and stage complexity.

## Outputs

- `ForecastResult` with predicted durations, effort points and confidence intervals.
- `RiskAssessment` summarising severity, likelihood and recommended mitigations.

## Stage 1 Behaviour

Implements deterministic heuristics: moving averages, weighted scoring and rule-based risk detection. Stage 2 introduces ML forecasting; Stage 3 integrates continuous learning.
