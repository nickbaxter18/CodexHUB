# CI/CD Specification

## Objective

Provide automated validation and deployment capabilities for Codex Meta-Intelligence deliverables while maintaining reproducibility and compliance.

## Components

- **Pipeline Controller (`src/cicd/pipeline.ts`)** – Declares build/test/deploy steps and orchestrates their execution.
- **Test Harness (`src/cicd/tests.ts`)** – Bridges QA outputs with Jest or external frameworks.
- **Linter Runner (`src/cicd/linters.ts`)** – Wraps ESLint, Prettier and additional linters.

## Stage 1 Workflow

1. Prepare workspace (install dependencies via pnpm).
2. Execute linting and unit tests.
3. Produce summary reports recorded in the memory subsystem.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate GitHub Actions, Render deployments and container image promotion.
- Implement caching, concurrency control and rollback strategies.
- Add security scanning and compliance reporting.
