"""Analytical helpers for auditing macro metadata coverage and readiness.

Header & Purpose:
    Provide utilities that inspect loaded macros to surface gaps ahead of QA/Meta
    Agent integrations.

Imports/Dependencies:
    * collections for counting ownership coverage.
    * dataclasses for structured reporting objects.
    * typing for type hints across the public API.

Types/Interfaces/Schemas:
    ``AgentCoverage`` summarises how many macros each agent owns.
    ``MetadataGaps`` lists macros lacking the metadata required by downstream
    agents.
    ``MacroReview`` composes the overall diagnostic payload returned to callers.

Core Logic/Implementation:
    ``generate_macro_review`` walks every macro, compiles coverage statistics,
    and returns actionable suggestions.

Error & Edge Handling:
    The helpers tolerate missing metadata by classifying those macros under
    "Unassigned" ownership and flagging them in the resulting report.

Performance Considerations:
    The operations are O(number of macros) and operate entirely in memory,
    which remains efficient for the current catalogue size.

Exports/Public API:
    ``generate_macro_review`` for consumers that need an actionable summary of
    the macro catalogue before orchestration.
