- **Security** — Authentication is represented with pluggable middleware that will evolve into MFA and RBAC in later stages.

- **Sustainability** — Energy utilities compute carbon intensity estimates so ESG metrics remain actionable.
- **Scalability** — Services are stateless and ready to adopt caching or background workers in Stage 2.
