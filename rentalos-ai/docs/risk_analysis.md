# Risk Analysis

RentalOS-AI addresses security, privacy, fairness, sustainability, operational, and
financial risks holistically. Each mitigation is already represented in Stage 3 code or
infrastructure configurationâ€”no placeholders remain.

## Security & Privacy Risks

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Risk of credential theft or privilege escalation.
  - _Mitigation:_ JWT + MFA middleware, RBAC/ABAC policy enforcement, rate limiting,
    suspicious login analytics, and rotating signing keys stored in vaults.
- **Data Exposure:** Unauthorized access to tenant, payment, or ESG data.
  - _Mitigation:_ Field-level encryption, Pydantic validation, scoped API tokens, audit
    logging with blockchain anchoring, and privacy request automation.
- **API Abuse & DoS:** Excessive requests, bot traffic, or replay attacks.
  - _Mitigation:_ Rate limiting, anomaly detection, WAF integration, request signatures,
    and adaptive throttling tied to observability metrics.
- **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:** Compromised dependencies or plugins.
  - _Mitigation:_ SBOM generation, dependency scanning, signature validation for plugins,
    sandbox execution, and automated revocation workflows.

## Fairness & Compliance Risks

- **Algorithmic Bias:** Pricing or screening decisions disadvantaging protected groups.
  - _Mitigation:_ Fairness metrics (parity, equal opportunity, calibration), Shapley-based
    explanations, bias alerts, and human-in-the-loop review with documented appeals.
- **Regulatory Breach:** Violating housing, lending, or energy market regulations.
  - _Mitigation:_ Jurisdiction-aware rule engine, compliance testing harness, legal update
    feeds, and auditable policy versioning.
- **Privacy Regulations (GDPR/CCPA):** Non-compliance with data rights requests.
  - _Mitigation:_ Automated workflows for access/export/deletion, consent tracking,
    immutable audit trails, and Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) documentation.

## Operational & Resilience Risks

- **Infrastructure Failure:** Database, cache, or blockchain downtime.
  - _Mitigation:_ Health/readiness probes, auto-restart policies, multi-region replicas,
    graceful degradation strategies, and chaos testing drills.
- **Event Stream Backpressure:** Kafka or queue saturation delaying alerts or IoT data.
  - _Mitigation:_ Backpressure monitoring, buffering, adaptive sampling, and fallback to
    direct API ingestion.
- **Plugin Misbehavior:** Third-party plugins introducing latency or security holes.
  - _Mitigation:_ Permission scopes, sandboxed execution, resource quotas, runtime health
    scoring, and kill-switch automation.

## Financial & Blockchain Risks

- **Payment Fraud:** Chargebacks, synthetic identities, or unauthorized transfers.
  - _Mitigation:_ AML/KYC checks, anomaly detection, escrow workflows, 3-D Secure, and
    manual review queues.
- **Smart Contract Bugs:** Vulnerabilities in tokenization or escrow contracts.
  - _Mitigation:_ Formal verification tooling, multi-signature approvals, staged rollouts,
    on-chain monitoring, and bug bounty programs.
- **Market Volatility:** Crypto or energy price swings affecting tenants or investors.
  - _Mitigation:_ Hedging strategies, stablecoin support, risk-adjusted pricing, and
    transparency dashboards.

## Sustainability & ESG Risks

- **Data Accuracy:** Faulty sensors or data gaps leading to incorrect ESG reporting.
  - _Mitigation:_ Sensor validation, anomaly detection, manual override workflows, and
    data provenance tracking.
- **Greenwashing Concerns:** Misreporting sustainability claims.
  - _Mitigation:_ Third-party certification integration, immutable audit logs, and public
    sustainability scorecards.
- **Energy Market Compliance:** Non-compliance with regional trading regulations.
  - _Mitigation:_ Rule engines per jurisdiction, regulatory API feeds, and automated
    reporting to authorities.

Risk mitigations are reviewed after each stage and logged in
`deploy_logs/changelog.md` to ensure accountability and continuous improvement.

## Residual Risks & Continuous Improvement Plan

- **Model Drift & Explainability Debt:** Despite automated drift detectors, rapid market
  swings or regulatory rule changes can outpace retraining cadences. Action: maintain
  quarterly model governance councils, publish interpretability scorecards, and rehearse
  emergency rollback drills.
- **Cross-Tenant Data Isolation:** Multi-tenant SaaS scaling introduces risk of noisy-neighbor
  effects and misconfigured isolation. Action: enforce tenant-aware row-level security,
  run quarterly penetration tests, and audit infrastructure-as-code for namespace
  segregation.
- **Third-Party Dependency Changes:** External APIs (credit bureaus, energy markets,
  drone regulators) can change contracts with little notice. Action: subscribe to
  provider change feeds, sandbox upcoming versions, and keep contract tests in CI to catch
  regressions before production.
- **Extreme Climate or Societal Events:** Catastrophic events may invalidate predictive
  assumptions and overwhelm maintenance or community services. Action: scenario-test
  disaster recovery plans, maintain emergency communication templates, and coordinate with
  sustainability partners for rapid relief workflows.
