# Sustainability & ESG Features

Sustainability is woven into every RentalOS-AI workflow. Carbon accounting, energy
trading, and ESG governance are not future promises—they are implemented and surfaced
across API endpoints, services, tests, and dashboards.

## Data Ingestion & Normalization

- IoT adapters collect energy (kWh), water (liters), waste (kg), air quality, and
  occupancy data with timestamped provenance.
- Data pipelines convert metrics into carbon equivalents (kgCO₂e) using regional emission
  factors and renewable sourcing metadata.
- Sensor validation, anomaly detection, and manual overrides ensure accuracy before data
  feeds analytics, pricing, and maintenance routines.

## Analytics & Dashboards

- ESG service aggregates per-asset and portfolio sustainability KPIs: carbon intensity,
  renewable utilization, waste diversion, water efficiency, indoor environmental quality,
  and social engagement metrics.
- Dashboards compare performance against regulatory thresholds, science-based targets, and
  peer benchmarks while highlighting recommended actions.
- Fairness dashboards expose correlations between sustainability initiatives and pricing
  or screening outcomes to guard against unintended bias.

## Energy Marketplace & Optimization

- Energy service enables renewable energy trading, demand-response incentives, and green
  inventory management.
- Pricing service rewards high ESG scores with incentives while factoring carbon costs
  into suggested rates.
- Plugins (e.g., `energy_optimizer`) match surplus generation with demand, track offset
  purchases, and ensure tamper-resistant records via signatures.

## Automation & Governance

- Automated carbon offset purchasing ties to verified registries; offsets include
  certificate IDs, retirement timestamps, and audit trails.
- Community modules encourage sustainable behaviour with event scores, recycling
  programs, and shared resource planning.
- Audit logs anchored to blockchain provide immutable evidence for ESG reports,
  regulatory filings, and investor transparency.

## Compliance & Reporting

- Reports align with CSRD/SFDR frameworks and can be exported for regulators or
  stakeholders.
- Sustainability benchmarks feed into performance bonuses, tenant incentives, and capital
  planning decisions.
- Risk analysis (see `docs/risk_analysis.md`) captures greenwashing safeguards, energy
  market compliance strategies, and data accuracy protocols.

## Impact Measurement & Continuous Optimization

- **Science-Based Targets:** ESG service tracks progress toward Science Based Targets
  initiative (SBTi) pathways, surfacing the delta to 1.5 °C-aligned trajectories per
  portfolio and asset class.
- **Carbon Abatement Curves:** Dashboards include marginal abatement cost curves so
  operators can prioritize interventions with the greatest emission reductions per dollar.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Tenant and vendor surveys feed Net Promoter and wellbeing
  indicators into ESG scoring, linking social impact to occupancy and retention metrics.
- **Circular Economy Metrics:** Inventory modules monitor recycled content percentage,
  refurbishment cycles, and waste diversion rates to quantify circularity improvements.
- **External Assurance:** Sustainability reports export machine-readable evidence packages
  (sensor data hashes, offset certificates) for third-party auditors.

## Future Outlook

Upcoming enhancements explore edge processing for on-site analytics, integration with
local energy cooperatives, circular economy inventory modules, and carbon-negative
operational targets powered by AI-driven retrofitting recommendations.
